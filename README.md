# broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk

Offline-first wrapper around the [`ndk`](https://pub.dev/packages/ndk) package's
broadcast use case.

NDK's `broadcast` sends a Nostr event to a set of relays and reports per-relay
results. If every relay is unreachable (flaky network, app backgrounded,
process killed), the event is gone from the caller's perspective. This shim
sits in front of `ndk.broadcast` and adds:

- **Local persistence first.** The event is committed to a sembast store
  before any network attempt. `broadcast()` returns once persistence is durable;
  delivery happens in the background and survives restarts.
- **100 % delivery guarantee.** An entry is only marked `delivered` once
  *every* targeted relay has returned `broadcastSuccessful: true`. Partial
  success keeps the entry pending and retries the missing relays.
- **Monotonic ack history.** A relay that has acked never un-acks. A delivered
  entry never silently flips back to pending due to a transient relay outage.
- **No auto-deletion.** Delivered entries stay in the store and can be
  re-broadcast later, for instance to a freshly discovered relay.

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk: ^0.1.0
  ndk: ^0.8.3
  sembast: ^3.8.7
```

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk/broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk.dart';
import 'package:ndk/ndk.dart';
import 'package:sembast/sembast_io.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final db = await databaseFactoryIo.openDatabase('broadcasts.db');

  final ndk = Ndk(
    NdkConfig(
      eventVerifier: Bip340EventVerifier(),
      cache: MemCacheManager(),
    ),
  );

  final outbox = OfflineBroadcast.withNdk(ndk, db: db);
  outbox.start();

  final event = Nip01Event(
    pubKey: myPubKey,
    kind: 1,
    tags: const [],
    content: 'hello from a flaky network',
  );

  // Returns as soon as the event is persisted. Delivery is now the shim's
  // responsibility.
  await outbox.broadcast(
    event,
    relays: const ['wss://relay.damus.io', 'wss://nos.lol'],
  );
}
```

## Semantics

### `broadcast(event, relays: [...])`

Persists `event` and schedules an immediate attempt to push it to every URL in
`relays`. The list is **required**: gossip-based relay selection is never
used. URLs are normalized (lowercased, trailing `/` stripped) before storage.

If a record with the same `event.id` already exists, the relay lists are
merged. `deliveredAt` is preserved if every relay in the merged list is
already in the entry's ack set; otherwise the entry is demoted to pending so
the missing relays get pushed.

### `retryNow()`

Forces an immediate scan of due entries, bypassing the online check. Use it
as an explicit override (e.g. when the user pulls to refresh).

### Connectivity awareness

`OfflineBroadcast.withNdk()` subscribes to
`ndk.connectivity.relayConnectivityChanges` and pauses the periodic retry
timer while no public relay is connected. As soon as a public relay comes
online, the shim replays everything that's due. Loopback addresses, RFC1918
IPv4, ULA/link-local IPv6, and mDNS `.local` names are excluded from the
"is online" computation so a local dev relay cannot mask a real outage.

For non-NDK setups, pass any `Stream<bool> onlineSignal` to the default
constructor:

```dart
OfflineBroadcast(
  broadcastFn: ...,
  db: db,
  onlineSignal: yourConnectivityStream, // true while online, false otherwise
);
```

If you don't pass anything, the shim assumes it is always online and the
periodic timer runs unconditionally (pre-0.2 behavior).

### `rebroadcast(id, {String? relay})`

`ackedRelays` and `deliveredAt` are monotonic. `rebroadcast` never rewrites
the past; it queues a one-shot push via a transient `forcedRelays` override
that the next attempt consumes.

- `rebroadcast(id)`: schedules an immediate push to **every** relay in the
  entry's `relays` list, including those that already acked. Useful when you
  suspect a relay dropped your event. Acks and `deliveredAt` are preserved
  regardless of the new attempt's outcome.
- `rebroadcast(id, relay: r)`: pushes to that single relay. If `r` is new
  to the entry, it joins the target list and the entry is demoted to pending
  until `r` acks. If `r` was already there, the historical state is
  preserved.

### What "success" means

The full target set must ack. NDK's own `considerDonePercent` knob is *not*
used as a delivery threshold; it only governs when the underlying future
completes, which is a different question.

### What the shim does NOT do

- **It never signs.** Whatever event you pass is forwarded as-is to
  `ndk.broadcast.broadcast`. If the event is unsigned, NDK signs it using its
  configured `EventSigner`. The shim has no opinion on signing.
- **It never deletes records.** Even after full delivery, the entry stays in
  the database. If you want retention, prune it yourself by clearing records
  from sembast directly.
- **It does not give up.** Without a `maxAttempts` knob, a deterministically
  rejected event (POW too low, kind not allowed by a relay, etc.) will retry
  forever with exponential backoff. Inspect `QueuedBroadcast.lastErrors` and
  manually remove if needed.

## Tuning

```dart
OfflineBroadcast.withNdk(
  ndk,
  db: db,
  storeName: 'broadcasts',                       // sembast store name
  tickInterval: const Duration(seconds: 30),     // periodic retry scan
  initialBackoff: const Duration(seconds: 5),    // backoff floor
  maxBackoff: const Duration(minutes: 30),       // backoff ceiling
  perAttemptTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 10),// gives up on a single NDK call after this
);
```

## Architecture in one diagram

```
caller.broadcast(event, relays)
        │
        ▼
  sembast write ──── durable, returns to caller here
        │
        ▼
  ndk.broadcast.broadcast(event, specificRelays: remaining)
        │
        ▼
  await broadcastDoneFuture
        │
        ▼
  per-relay union into ackedRelays  ────►  delivered when ⊇ relays
  per-relay error into lastErrors          (otherwise schedule backoff)
```

A `Timer.periodic` scans `findDue` every `tickInterval` and replays whatever
is overdue. `retryNow()` runs the same scan immediately.

## Testing your integration

`OfflineBroadcast` is fully unit-testable without NDK. Pass a custom
`BroadcastFn` to the default constructor:

```dart
final outbox = OfflineBroadcast(
  broadcastFn: (event, relays) => NdkBroadcastResponse(
    publishEvent: event,
    broadcastDoneStream: Stream.value([
      for (final r in relays)
        RelayBroadcastResponse(
          relayUrl: r,
          okReceived: true,
          broadcastSuccessful: true,
        ),
    ]),
  ),
  db: await newDatabaseFactoryMemory().openDatabase('test.db'),
);
```

The package's own test suite uses exactly this approach; see
[`test/offline_broadcast_test.dart`](https://github.com/nogringo/broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk/blob/main/test/offline_broadcast_test.dart).
